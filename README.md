### PREPARING DATA FOR ANALYSIS:

1. I want to analyze the sales month and year wise for that I will create a month column and year column and extract month and year from Invoice data column using =Text function.

2. Also it will be better if we further classify products on the basis of gender and the type of product- for that i will create a product and gender column and extract the relevant data from the product column.


# DATA ANALYSIS

1. I created a column chart to check month wise sales.

2. Then I created a pie chart to see the share of regions in total sales.

3. Another pie chart showing total sales gender wise.

4. Then I created a combo chart showing sales of each retailer with average profit margin.

5. After that I created an area chart to show sales of each year by product.

6. Bar chart is created to show the average price per unit by state.

7. Correlation between price and sales. For better representation I created a scatter plot to check if there is any correlation between them.
