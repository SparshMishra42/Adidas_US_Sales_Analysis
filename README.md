# DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION

## CLEANING THE DATASET:

1. Check for duplicates- No such values found

2. Blank Values- No Blank values

3. Formatting- Proper formatting

Hence, the data is clean.

### PREPARING DATA FOR ANALYSIS:

1. I want to analyze the sales month and year wise for that I will create a month column and year column and extract month and year from Invoice data column using =Text function.

2. Also it will be better if we further classify products on the basis of gender and the type of product- for that i will create a product and gender column and extract the relevant data from the product column.


# DATA ANALYSIS

1. I created a column chart to check month wise sales.

2. Then I created a pie chart to see the share of regions in total sales.

3. Another pie chart showing total sales gender wise.

4. Then I created a combo chart showing sales of each retailer with average profit margin.

5. After that I created an area chart to show sales of each year by product.

6. Bar chart is created to show the average price per unit by state.

7. Correlation between price and sales. For better representation I created a scatter plot to check if there is any correlation between them.


# INSIGHTS

1. New York state has the highest share in sales at 7.137% or $64,229,039 followed by Florida at 6.588% or $59,283,714.

2. If we see which sales method has recorded the highest sales or contribution in total sales, In-store sales contribute to 39.63% whereas Outlet contributes to 32.85% and Online at 27.52%.

3. In 2020, April recorded the highest sales at $24,607,006 and December recorded the lowest at $ 8,026,527. In the year 2021, July and December had the highest sales at $78,334,681 and $77,815,430.

4. If we compare 2020 and 2021 sales. we can clearly see that the 2021 sales are way more than 2020 sales. Even the lowest of 2021 sales is way more higher than 2020 highest sales.

5. Seeing sales by each region, the West contributes to 30% which is the highest, next is the Northeast which has 20.7% share. We can see that these 2 regions contribute to 50% sales. Rest is divided into 3 
   regions, lowest of these is Midwest at 15.09%.

6. Last we see retailer sales, out of 6 retailers, West Gear has highest sales at $ 242,964,333 with 625,262 units followed by Foot Locker at $ 220,094,720 with 604,369 units while Walmart has lowest at $ 
   74,558,410.

7. Then through scatterplot we can see there is a positive correlation between price and units sold. As the demand increases the price of the product increases.
